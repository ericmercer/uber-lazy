There are two rewrite rules in~\figref{fig:fHeap}(a), one for reading
the value of a field (field-access) and the other when we write to a
field (field-write). Both rules first check that the operations can be
performed on a non-null location. If such is the case, then the global
constraint $\phi_g$ is updated to disallow any viable null locations
from this point forward: future accesses are non-null.
%perform is whether there exists a constraint location pair for the $r$
%being accessed such that the location is not null and the constraint
%when conjuncted with the global constraint is satisfiable. Next we
%extract all possible constraints under which $r$ points to a null
%location such that the constraint is satisfiable under the current
%global constraint, $\phi_g$. The negation of these constraints are
%added to the global constraint to create a new global constraint
%$\phi_g^\prime$.
%The update to the global constraint ensures that
%access or write of the field $f$ happens only on non-null
%locations. 
When there is a feasible null location in the summary heap on the
field access operations, the machine moves to an error state. The
rewrite rules for null locations are in the supplemental document.

In the field-access rewrite rule in~\figref{fig:fHeap}(a), after the
null check, the rule gets the field type $\cfgnt{C}$ and uses
the summarize machine, \figref{fig:symInit}, to get a new summary heap
that is initialized on the field $\cfgnt{f}$. After
initialization, the summary heap is further modified to include 
a new stack reference pointing to the value set from
the read. The new stack reference is the return value from the operation.
\input{value-set-def}
The value set computation is local: it only considers
constraint locations on the reference $\cfgnt{r}$. Further, it only
includes things that are feasible under the current path condition
$\phi_g$. It also ensures that the access path valid. 

There is a constraint $\phi$ from the base reference $r$ and a given
location. Once a location $l$ is selected, the field $\cfgnt{f}$ is accessed to get
another reference $r^\prime$, and from that reference there is a set of locations
each with a constraint. The first constraint $\phi$ from the base reference
plus this second constraint to the actual location of the field $\phi^\prime$
comprise the access path. For each member of the value set, these
constraints together with the global path constraint must be satisfied
on some aliasing assignment.

\begin{comment}invoke the summarize rewrite rule
in~\figref{fig:symInit} that performs the initialization of the field
if it points to uninitialized locations. Once the initialization is
complete, we create a new local reference $r^\prime$. An important
property of the references in the bi-partiate graph is that they are
\emph{immutable}. Hence we create a new local reference and assign it
to the initialized reference, and return the local reference. In order
to de-reference a field $r.f$ we define a helper function which is
called the value set.

In the post-condition of the rewrite rule we assign
the value set of input reference $r$ to the local reference $r^\prime$
and return the local reference $r^\prime$ in the next state.
\end{comment}

Consider the graph shown in~\figref{fig:fHeap}(b). The goal is to
complete the operation $\lp\cfgt{this}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{y}\rp$. The
machine first evaluates the local variable look up to get the base
reference: $\eta(\cfgt{this}) = \cfgnt{r}^s_0$. From the base
reference, field access is able to complete returning the stack
reference $\cfgnt{r}_3^s$ in the figure. The reference $\cfgnt{r}_3^s$
points to the value set of $\cfgnt{r}_2^i$:
$(\phi_{2a}\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null})$, $(\phi_{2b}\ \cfgnt{l}_2)$,
and $(\phi_{2c}\ \cfgnt{l}_1)$.

For field-write in~\figref{fig:fHeap}(a), after the
non-null check and strengthening of the global heap constraint, it computes the current references associated with the field in every location in $\Psi_\cfgnt{x}$. Please note that the reference $\cfgnt{r}_x$ is the base reference
whose field, $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$ is being written to while the
reference $r$ is the target reference. The set $\Psi_x$ contains
tuples $(\phi\ l\ \cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur})$ of constraints, locations, and
references. These tuples represent access chains leading from $\cfgnt{r}_x$ to
the reference of the field, $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$. The goal is to change the fields to no longer point to $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$, but rather fresh references that have both the original locations before the write and the locations from the write in the value sets (i.e., conditional write). Since the target of the write is $r$, the rule checks that
the location constraint pairs of $\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r})$ are satisfiable when accessed
through the $\cfgnt{r}_x$ chain in the strengthening function.
\input{st-def}
Constraints on locations are strengthened with new aliasing conditions
and those that are feasible with the current path constraint are
retained. 

Strengthening in the field write creates a value set that
contains two types of locations:  those for the case where the write is feasible (the
first call), and those for the case where it is not (the second call). 
This is the conditional in the write. In the case that $\phi$ is true
then $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$ will point to the constraint location pairs of
$\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r})$ while if $\phi$ is false then $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$ will continue
to point to the constraint location pair it is currently referenced.
As the references are immutable, the rule creates fresh references for
each $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$ and points them to the appropriate value sets.

Consider again the example shown in~\figref{fig:fHeap}(b) where we assign
$\lp\cfgt{this}\  \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{x}\ \cfgt{:=}\ \lp\cfgt{this}\  \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{y}\rp\rp$. Note that
in~\figref{fig:initHeap}(c) $\lp\cfgt{this}\  \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{x}\rp$ is represented by
$\cfgnt{r}_1^i$. After applying the field-write rule the reference $\cfgnt{r}_1^i$ is
replaced by the fresh reference $\cfgnt{r}_4$ which now points to target
 $\lp\cfgt{this}\  \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{y}\rp$ represented by $\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_2^i)$.

The rewrite rules to compare two references in the symbolic summary
heap are shown in~\figref{fig:eqs}. The equals references-true rewrite
rule returns true when two references $\cfgnt{r}_0$ and $\cfgnt{r}_1$ \emph{can} be
equal. In GSE semantics, checking equality of references is a simple
comparision of two concrete object references. In the symbolic summary
heap, however, we compare sets of constraint location pairs pointed to
by each reference to determine if equality is possible. 

Consider the equals reference-true rewrite rule
in~\figref{fig:eqs}. In order to check equality, three
sets of constraints are used. For all constraint location pairs $(\phi_0\ \cfgnt{l}_0)
\in \cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_0)$ and $(\phi_1\ \cfgnt{l}_1) \in \cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_1)$ such that $\cfgnt{l}_0$ and $\cfgnt{l}_1$
are the same ($\cfgnt{l}_0 = \cfgnt{l}_1$), the rule creates conjunctions of the constraints
$\phi_0 \wedge \phi_1$ and add them to set $\Phi_\alpha$. Intutively,
$\Phi_\alpha$ contains all constraints under which $\cfgnt{r}_0$ and $\cfgnt{r}_1$ may
point to the same location in the symbolic summary heap. The second
set, $\Phi_0$, contains constraints under which the reference $\cfgnt{r}_0$
points to corresponding locations such that the reference $\cfgnt{r}_1$
\emph{does not} point to those locations under any
constraint. Finally, the set, $\Phi_1$, contains constraints under
which $\cfgnt{r}_1$ points to corresponding locations and $\cfgnt{r}_0$ \emph{does
  not} point to those locations under any constraint.

We use the three sets of constraints to update the current global heap
constraint $\phi_g$ and create a new global heap constraint
$\phi_g^\prime$. We add to $\phi_g$ the disjunction of the constraints
in $\Phi_\alpha$ to indicate that if any of the constraints are
satisfiable, then references $\cfgnt{r}_0$ and $\cfgnt{r}_1$ can be
equal. Furthermore, we conjoin to the global heap constraint 
$\phi_g^\prime$, the conjunctions of negations to the constraints in
$\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_1$. This indicates for locations that are not
common to the references, the negations of their constraints are
satisfiable. The rule does not complete (i.e., is not feasible) if the new
 global constraint is not satisfied on any aliasing assignment. In such a case, 
 the $\cfgt{true}$ outcome is not possible on any heap in the summary.

Before the rewrite rule returns $\cfgt{true}$ we check the
satisfiability of the updated global heap constraint.

Consider the example in~\figref{fig:initHeap}(c). In order to to check
if $\cfgnt{r}_1^i$ and $\cfgnt{r}_2^i$ are equal we first get the constraint location
pairs associated with each of the references:
\[
\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_1^i) = \{ (\phi_{1a}\; \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null})\; (\phi_{1b}\; \cfgnt{l}_1) \} 
\]
\[
\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_2^i) = \{ (\phi_{2a}\; \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null})\; (\phi_{2b}\; \cfgnt{l}_2)\; (\phi_{2c}\; \cfgnt{l}_1) \} \\
\]
\noindent{The three constraint sets are:} 
\[
\Phi_\alpha = \{ (\phi_{1a}\; \wedge\; \phi_{2a} ) (\phi_{1b}\; \wedge\; \phi_{2c} ) \}\;
\Phi_0 = \{ \}\; \Phi_1 = \{ \phi_{2b}\} \\
\]
\noindent{Finally the global constraint is} 
\[
\phi^\prime = \mathit{true} \wedge [ (\phi_{1a}\; \wedge\; \phi_{2a} )\vee (\phi_{1b}\; \wedge\; \phi_{2c} ) ] \wedge \neg\phi_{2b} 
\]
\noindent{The equals references-false rule is the logical dual of the
  reference-true rewrite rule. The references-false rule is also shown
  in~\figref{fig:eqs}.}
