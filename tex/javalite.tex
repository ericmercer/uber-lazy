\section{Preliminaries}

\figref{fig:surface-syntax} defines the surface syntax for the
Javalite language \cite{saints-MS}. \figref{fig:machine-syntax} is the
machine syntax. Javalite is syntactic machine defined as rewrites on a
string. The semantics use a CEKS model with a (C)ontrol string
representing the expression being evaluated, an (E)nvironment for
local variables, a (K)ontinuation for what is to be executed next, and
a (S)tore for the heap.

\subsection{Environment}
The environment, $\eta$, associates a variable $\cfgnt{x}$ with a
value $\cfgnt{v}$. The value can be a reference, $\cfgnt{r}$ or one of
the special values $\cfgt{null}$, $\cfgt{true}$, or
$\cfgt{false}$. Although the Javalite machine is purely syntactic, for
clarity and brevity in the presentation, the more complex structures
such as the environment are treated as partial functions. As such,
$\eta(\cfgnt{x}) = \cfgnt{r}$ is the reference mapped to the variable
in the environment. The notation $\eta^\prime = \eta[\cfgnt{x} \mapsto
  \cfgnt{v}]$ defines a new partial function $\eta^\prime$ that is
just like $\eta$ only the variable $\cfgnt{x}$ now maps to
$\cfgnt{v}$.
