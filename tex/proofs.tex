\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:lazyrefprops}
For any lazy state $s_\ell = ( \cfgnt{L}_\ell\ \cfgnt{R}_\ell\ \phi_\ell\ \eta_\ell\ \cfgnt{e}_\ell\ \cfgnt{k}_\ell )$, for any reference $r \in \cfgnt{L}_\ell^\leftarrow$, 
$$ | \cfgnt{L}_\ell ( r) | = 1 $$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
In every rule in the Lazy machine that establishes a reference mapping, the value set contains exactly one location, constraint pair. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:mutex}
If we have a summary state $s_s = ( \cfgnt{L}_s\ \cfgnt{R}_s\ \phi_s\ \eta_s\ \cfgnt{e}_s\ \cfgnt{k}_s )$, then for any reference $r \in \cfgnt{L}_s^\leftarrow$, and any two pairs $(\phi_\alpha\ l_\alpha) &\in \cfgnt{L}_s(r)$ and $(\phi_\beta\ l_\beta) &\in \cfgnt{L}_s(r)$ such that $l_\alpha &\ne l_\beta$, then
%\begin{align*}
%(\phi_\alpha\ l_\alpha) &\in \cfgnt{L}_s(r)\\
%(\phi_\beta\ l_\beta) &\in \cfgnt{L}_s(r)\\
%l_\alpha &\ne l_\beta
%\end{align*}
$$(\phi_\alpha \wedge \phi_\beta) = \cfgt{false}$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof will proceed inductively. For the base case, consider any initial state $s_0$. The property holds by construction. (Hands waving around in the air for emphasis)

Now we will show that if the exclusivity property holds for some state $s_s$, then it holds for any state $s_s^\prime$ where $s_s \rightarrow_s s_s^\prime$.

First, suppose we have state $s_s$ and intermediate state $s_s^\prime$ where $s_s \rightarrow_S s_s^\prime$. If all fields are initialized, then $s_s$ and $s_s^\prime$ are identical, so the property holds for $s_s^\prime$. If any field is uninitialized, then the fields are initialized to new references, for which the exclusivity property holds by construction. (More hands waving)

Since the exclusivity property holds for every intermediate state, for any instruction that relies on the summary machine we can assume without loss of generality that all pertinent fields are initialized.

Now, suppose we have a field read instruction. When we read the field, a new value set is created based on the $\mathbb{VS}$ function. The members of the value set have the form $(\phi\wedge \phi^\prime\ \ l)$. Choose any two distinct members of the value set, $(\phi_\alpha \wedge \phi_\alpha^\prime\ \ l_\alpha)$ and $(\phi_\beta \wedge \phi_\beta^\prime\ \ l_\beta)$. If $\phi_\alpha \ne \phi_\beta$, we know that exclusivity holds because $\phi_\alpha$ and $\phi_\beta$ came from the same value set in $s_s$, and are therefore exclusive. If $\phi_\alpha = \phi_\beta$, we know that exclusivity holds because $\phi_\alpha^\prime$ and $\phi_\beta^\prime$ came from the same value set in $s_s$ and are therefore exclusive. Thus, the exclusivity property holds for any pair of constraints in the value set. Since the only new value set in $L_{s^\prime}^\rightarrow$ is generated by the $\mathbb{VS}$ function, we are guaranteed that if exclusivity holds for $s_s$, then exclusivity holds for $s_s^\prime$.

Suppose we have a field write instruction. This case is nearly identical as the field read. In this instruction, a new value set is created. The members of the value set have the form $(\phi\wedge \phi^\prime\ \ l)$. Choose any two distinct members of the value set, $(\phi_\alpha \wedge \phi_\alpha^\prime\ \ l_\alpha)$ and $(\phi_\beta \wedge \phi_\beta^\prime\ \ l_\beta)$. If $\phi_\alpha \ne \phi_\beta$, we know that exclusivity holds because $\phi_\alpha = \neg \phi_\beta$, so $\phi_\alpha$ and $\phi_\beta$ are therefore exclusive. If $\phi_\alpha = \phi_\beta$, we know that exclusivity holds because $\phi_\alpha^\prime$ and $\phi_\beta^\prime$ came from the same value set in $s_s$ and are therefore exclusive. Thus, the exclusivity property holds for any pair of constraints in the value set. Since exclusivity holds for the only new value set in $L_{s^\prime}^\rightarrow$, we are guaranteed that if exclusivity holds for $s_s$, then exclusivity holds for $s_s^\prime$.

Suppose we have a "new" instruction. In this case, only one value set is added to $L_{s^\prime}^\rightarrow$, and that value set contains only one member, so exclusivity holds by default.

Suppose we have any instruction other that a read, write, or new. No machine rule other than those three listed instructions modifies the $L$ function. Therefore, the exclusivity property must hold for $s_s^\prime$ in these cases.

Since the exclusivity property holds for any initial state, and since it holds for any "next" state if the property holds for the previous state, we have proven the property for every symbolic state.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:ref}
For any symbolic state $s_s$, constraint $\phi$, and stack reference $\cfgnt{r}$ such that $(\phi\ \ell) \in \cfgnt{L}_s (\cfgnt{r})$, then 
\begin{equation}
\exists \Gamma_n^s\ ( \phi = \mathbb{PC} (\Gamma_n^s) )
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:path}
If there is some access path $\Gamma_n^s$ in state $s_s$ such that $\mathbb{S}(\phi_s \wedge \mathbb{PC}(\Gamma_n^s))$, then $\Gamma_n^\ell$ is an access path in some lazy state $s_\ell$ such that $s_\ell \sqsubset s_s$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:init}
If symbolic state $s_s = \lp \cfgnt{L}_{\mathcal{S}}\ \cfgnt{R}_{\mathcal{S}}\ \phi_g\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}\ \lp \cfgt{*}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f} \rightarrow \cfgnt{k}\rp \rp$ is exact with respect to some initial state $s_0$ and control flow path $\pi_n$, then the intermediate state state $s_f : s_s \rightarrow_S s_f$ is equivalent to $\{\forall s_\ell^\prime | \exists s_\ell \sqsubset s_s (s_\ell \rightarrow_I^* s_\ell^\prime)  \}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}%going through this one quickly, could be more formal...
Given a lazy state $s_\ell \sqsubset s_s$, there are four distinct possibilities for $s_\ell^\prime$: either the field is already initialized, or the field is initialized to a new reference, the null reference, or an alias.

Case 1: Suppose the field is initialized. In this case, the rule does nothing and the theorem is trivially true.

%for the next case, we need to show that the constraints in the symbolic heap don't allow any infeasible heaps. The key to this will be in showing that the constraints are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. Mutually exclusive constraints are required because lazy heaps only point to one place at at time. Collectively exhaustive constraints are required to eliminate any other possible heaps. We could start by explicitly enumerating the members of the product feasible set, and working from there to show that the symbolic heap is equivalent to that set. Or, we might do this on a case-by-case basis to show that for an arbitrary lazy state, any of it's three possible target states is in the feasible set.

Case 2: The "new" rule gets executed. 

Case 3: The "null" rule gets executed.

Case 4: The "alias" rule gets executed.
\end{proof}

%we need to define how r' is arrived at for this one to work...
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:access}
If there are symbolic states $s_s$ and $s_s^\prime$, control sequences $\pi_n$ and $\pi_{n+1}$, initial state $s_0$, and reference $\cfgnt{r}^\prime$ such that the following conditions hold:
\begin{align}
s_s &= \lp \cfgnt{L}_{\mathcal{S}}\ \cfgnt{R}_{\mathcal{S}}\ \phi_g\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}\ \lp \cfgt{*}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f} \rightarrow \cfgnt{k}\rp \rp \\
s_s &\cong \mathbb{FS}\lp \rightarrow_{\phi},s_0,\pi_n\rp \\
\cfgnt{r}^\prime &= \mathrm{fresh}_r\lp \rp \\
\pi_{n+1} &=\pi_n\ \lp \eta\ \cfgnt{r}^\prime\ \cfgnt{k} \rp \\
s_s &\rightarrow_s s_s^\prime
\end{align}
%$$s_s = \lp \cfgnt{L}_{\mathcal{S}}\ \cfgnt{R}_{\mathcal{S}}\ \phi_g\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}\ \lp \cfgt{*}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f} \rightarrow \cfgnt{k}\rp \rp$$ 
%$$s_s \cong \mathbb{FS}\lp \rightarrow_{\phi},s_0,\pi_n\rp$$ 
%$$\pi_{n+1} =\pi_n\ \lp \eta\ \cfgnt{r}^\prime\ \cfgnt{k} \rp$$ 

then 
$$s_s^\prime \cong \mathbb{FS}\lp \rightarrow_{\phi},s_0,\pi_{n+1} \rp$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will consider two cases for this proof. In the first case, we assume that all of the fields involved in the read are initialized. In the second case we consider the case of uninitialized fields. 

Case 1: suppose all of the pertinent fields in $s_s$ are initialized. Take an arbitrary lazy state $s_\ell$ such that $s_\ell \sqsubset s_s$. Since $s_s$ is exact,  $s_\ell = \lp \cfgnt{L}_{\ell}\ \cfgnt{R}_{\ell}\ \phi_\ell\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}\ \lp \cfgt{*}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f} \rightarrow \cfgnt{k} \rp \rp$, and $s_\ell \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_n)$. If we apply the state transition functions to achieve states $s_\ell^\prime$ and $s_s^\prime$ such that $s_\ell \rightarrow_\ell s_\ell^\prime$ and  $s_s \rightarrow_s s_s^\prime$, we find that:
$$s_\ell^\prime = \lp \cfgnt{L}_{\ell} [\cfgnt{r}^\prime \mapsto \lp\phi^\prime\ l^\prime\rp]\ \cfgnt{R}_{\ell}\ \phi_L\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}^\prime\ \cfgnt{k}\rp $$
 and 
 $$ s_s^\prime = \lp \cfgnt{L}_{s}[\cfgnt{r}^\prime \mapsto \mathbb{VS}\lp \cfgnt{L}_{\mathcal{S}},\cfgnt{R}_{s},\cfgnt{r},\cfgnt{f},\phi_g\rp ]\ \cfgnt{R}_{\mathcal{S}}\ \phi_g\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}^\prime\ \cfgnt{k}\rp $$

We now show that $s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$. Since $\eta$, $e$, and $k$ are identical between $s_s^\prime$ and $s_\ell^\prime $, the first condition is met by default. Now we construct functions $g^\prime$ and $h^\prime$ such that $g^\prime = g[ r^\prime \mapsto r^\prime]$ and $h^\prime = h$. Observe that since $s_\ell \rightharpoonup_{(g\ h)} s_s$, and since $\cfgnt{R}_\ell$ and $\cfgnt{R}_s$ are unchanged from states $s_\ell$ to $s_\ell^\prime$ and $s_s$ to $s_s^\prime$ respectively, we are guaranteed that $ r = \cfgnt{R}_\ell(l,f) \Rightarrow g^\prime(r) = \cfgnt{R}_s(h^\prime(l),f)$. Since $(\phi_\ell^\prime\ l^\prime) =  \cfgnt{L}_\ell(\cfgnt{R}_\ell(l,f))$, and since $(g\ h)$ is valid, we know that:
 $$(\phi_s \wedge \phi_s^\prime\ l^\prime) \in \mathbb{VS}\lp \cfgnt{L}_{\mathcal{S}},\cfgnt{R}_{s},\cfgnt{r},\cfgnt{f},\phi_g\rp$$ 
From this, we may deduce that:
$$ (\phi_\ell\ l) \in \cfgnt{L}_\ell^\prime(r^\prime) \Rightarrow (\phi_s \wedge \phi_s^\prime\ h^\prime(l))\in \cfgnt{L}_s^\prime(g^\prime(r^\prime))$$
Since $r^\prime$ is the only new addition to $L_\ell^\prime$ and $L_s^\prime$, we now know that the assertion above holds for all $l \in \mathcal{L}$. Thus, we have shown that $s_\ell^\prime \rightharpoonup_{(g\ h)} s_s^\prime$. Furthermore, since $\mathbb{S}(\phi_s\wedge\phi_s^\prime\wedge \phi_g)$ evaluates to $\cfgt{true}$, we know that equation \ref{eqn:valid} also evaluates to $\cfgt{true}$. Since there is a valid heap homomorphism, and since $\eta_{\ell} = \eta_{s} ,\ \cfgnt{e}_{\ell} = \cfgnt{e}_{s} ,\ \cfgnt{k}_{\ell} = \cfgnt{k}_{s}$, by Definition \ref{representation} we know $s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$. We have now shown that for any lazy state $s_\ell$: 
$$s_\ell \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_n) \Rightarrow s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$$
Since there is only one possible control flow sequence $\pi_{n+1}$, this means that if $s_\ell \rightarrow_\ell s_\ell^\prime$, then $$s_\ell \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_n) \Leftrightarrow s_\ell^\prime\ \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n+1})$$
Combining the two previous equations, we may finally conclude that $s_s^\prime$ is complete with respect to $\mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n+1})$
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:readforwards}
s_\ell^\prime \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n+1}) \Rightarrow s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime
\end{equation}

%there is a little hand-waving here. We claim that that a valid (g' h') implies a valid (g h), but the reason for this is actually pretty subtle and should probably be detailed better. Basically, it depends on the fact that the value set for the returned reference is contingent on the entire access path from the root of the heap. Another hand-wavy part is showing that the lazy machine will turn si into si'. Finally, we still need to show that if we run the lazy machine on every feasible state in si that we get every feasible state in si' .

%Now, suppose that there exists a state $s_i^\prime$ such that $s_i^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$, but $s_i^\prime \notin \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n+1})$. Since $s_i^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$, then by Lemma \ref{lem:ref}, $\cfgnt{r}^\prime$ represents a valid path $\Gamma_{n+1}^{s\prime}$, in states $s_i^\prime$ and $s_s^\prime$. Furthermore, by Lemma \ref{lem:path} we can surmise that $\mathbb{S}(\phi_s^\prime \wedge \mathbb{PC}(\Gamma_{n+1}^{s\prime}))$. By construction, $\Gamma_{n+1}^{s\prime}$ is an extension of the valid access path $\Gamma_{n}^{s}$ represented by reference $\cfgnt{r}$ in state $s_s$. Since $s_s$ is exact, there exists state $s_i$ such that $s_i \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n})$. and by our previous result, $s_i^\prime \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n+1})$. We have a contradiction.

Now, suppose that there exists a state $s_i^\prime$ such that $s_i^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$, but $s_i^\prime \notin \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n+1})$. Since $s_i^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$, then by Definition \ref{representation}, we know there exists a homomorphism $s_i^\prime \rightharpoonup_{(g^\prime\ h^\prime)} s_s^\prime$, and that $\mathbb{S}( \phi_s^\prime \wedge \mathbb{HC}(s_i^\prime \rightharpoonup_{(g^\prime\ h^\prime)} s_s^\prime) )$. From state $s_i^\prime$, construct state $s_i$ such that 
\begin{align*}
s_i &= \lp \cfgnt{L}_{i}\ \cfgnt{R}_{i}\ \phi_i\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}\ \lp \cfgt{*}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f} \rightarrow \cfgnt{k}\rp \rp\\
L_i &= L_i^\prime \setminus \cfgnt{r}^\prime \\
R_i &= R_{i^\prime}\\
\phi_i &= \phi_i^\prime
\end{align*}
Observe that $s_i \rightarrow_\ell s_i^\prime$. Now, construct functions $g_i$ and $h_i$ so that $g_i = g^\prime \setminus \cfgnt{r}^\prime$ and $h_i = h^\prime$. Observe that $s_i \rightharpoonup_{(g_i\ h_i)} s_s$, and that $\mathbb{S}( \phi_i \wedge \mathbb{HC}(s_i \rightharpoonup_{(g_i\ h_i)} s_s) )$, so $s_i \sqsubset s_s$. By the hypothesis that $s_s$ is exact, $s_i \in\mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_n)$. Combining this with the fact that $s_i \rightarrow_\ell s_i^\prime$, we conclude that $s_i^\prime \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n+1})$. We have a contradiction.

 Therefore, $s_s^\prime$ is sound with respect to $\mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n+1})$
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eqn:readbackwards}
 s_i^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime \Rightarrow s_i^\prime \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n+1})
 \end{equation}
Since $s_s$ is both sound and complete, we may combine Equations \ref{eqn:readforwards} and \ref{eqn:readbackwards} to find that 
$$s_\ell^\prime \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n+1}) \Leftrightarrow s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$$
By Definition \ref{equivalent}, $s_s^\prime \cong \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_n)$, and so by Definition \ref{exact}, $s_s^\prime$ is exact.

Case 2: If there are uninitialized fields, then the lazy initialization machine will make an intermediate state $s_t$. By lemma \ref{lem:init}, the symbolic state is equivalent to the set of lazy initialized states. From the intermediate state, the proof is the same as for case 1.
\end{proof}

%proof for field write
\begin{lemma}
The field write rule is correct.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

%proof for reference compares. Here we will rely on the fact that since the L and R functions don't change, and since the phi function
\begin{lemma}
If symbolic state $s_s =  \lp \cfgnt{L}_s\ \cfgnt{R}_s\ \phi_s\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}_0\ \lp \cfgnt{r}_1\; \cfgt{=}\; \cfgt{*} \rightarrow \cfgnt{k}\rp \rp$ is exact with respect to some initial state $s_0$ and control flow path $\pi_n$, then the state $s_s^\prime : s_s \rightarrow_s s_s^\prime$ is exact with respect to $s_0$ and $\pi_{n+1}$.
\end{lemma}
There are two rules that apply to state $s_s$, one for the $\cfgt{true}$ branch and one for the $\cfgt{false}$ branch. Since the proofs for both rules are nearly identical, for clarity we will only prove the case for the $\cfgt{true}$ branch here. 
\begin{proof}
Choose any $s_\ell \sqsubset s_s$, and let $\zeta_T = \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,(\pi_n,(\eta\ \cfgt{true}\ \cfgnt{k})))$. Since $s_s$ is exact, we know that $s_\ell \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_n)$, $s_l = \lp \cfgnt{L}_\ell\ \cfgnt{R}_\ell\ \phi_\ell\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}_0\ \lp \cfgnt{r}_1\; \cfgt{=}\; \cfgt{*} \rightarrow \cfgnt{k}\rp \rp$, and that there exists $(g\ h) : s_\ell \rightarrow s_s$. 
Depending on the values of $\cfgnt{L}_\ell \lp \cfgnt{r}_0\rp$ and $\cfgnt{L}_\ell \lp \cfgnt{r}_1 \rp$, there are two different rules that might apply to $s_\ell$.
%I'm not sure we actually use this fact anywhere
 %In either case, $\cfgnt{L}_\ell$ and $\cfgnt{R}_\ell$ are unchanged, and $\phi_\ell$ is strengthened, so we already know that 
%$$ \zeta_T \subseteq \{s_\ell^\prime | \exists s_\ell \in \mathbb{FS}(\rightarrow_{\ell},s_0,\pi_{n}) (s_\ell \rightarrow_\ell s_\ell^\prime )\}$$

Case 1: Assume $s_\ell : \cfgnt{L}_\ell \lp \cfgnt{r}_0\rp = \cfgnt{L}_\ell \lp \cfgnt{r}_1 \rp$, and let 
$$\zeta_t = \zeta_T \setminus \{ s_f | \cfgnt{L}_f \lp \cfgnt{r}_0\rp \neq \cfgnt{L}_f \lp \cfgnt{r}_1 \rp \}$$ In this case, the lazy ``equals - references true" rule applies, and we know state $s_\ell^\prime : s_\ell \rightarrow_\ell s_\ell^\prime$ is in $\zeta_t$. Since $(g\ h)$ is valid, we know that $\exists \lp \phi_0\ l \rp \in \cfgnt{L}_\ell\lp g \lp \cfgnt{r}_0\rp \rp$, $\exists \lp \phi_1\ l \rp \in \cfgnt{L}_\ell\lp g \lp \cfgnt{r}_1\rp \rp$, and that $\mathbb{S}\lp\phi_s\wedge\phi_0\wedge \phi_1\rp$ holds true. Observe that by applying theorem \ref{thm:mutex}, $\phi_s^\prime \wedge \phi_0 \wedge \phi_1$ reduces to $\phi_s$. Therefore, $\lp g\ h \rp: s_\ell^\prime \rightarrow s_s^\prime$ is a valid heap homomorphism, and by extension, $s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$. Since this relation holds for arbitrary $s_\ell^\prime \in \zeta_t$, we now know that $$s_\ell^\prime \in \zeta_t \Rightarrow s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$$
Now we prove the case for the other direction. Consider the state $s_s^\prime : s_s \rightarrow_s s_s^\prime$. Define $\theta_\alpha$, $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ as in the ``equals (references-true) rule''. Since $\cfgnt{L}_s$ and $\cfgnt{R}_s$ are unchanged from $s_s$, and $\phi_g$ is only strengthened,  we know that:
$$\{s_\ell^\prime | s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime \} \subseteq \{s_\ell^\prime | \exists s_\ell \lp s_\ell \sqsubset s_s \rp \wedge s_\ell \rightarrow_s s_\ell^\prime\} $$
Suppose that there exists state $s_i^\prime$ such that $s_i^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$ and $s_i^\prime \notin \zeta_t$. Because of the above conclusion, we know that $$s_i^\prime \in \{s_\ell^\prime | \exists s_\ell \lp s_\ell \sqsubset s_s\rp \wedge s_\ell \rightarrow_s s_\ell^\prime\}$$ Combining this with the assumption that $s_i^\prime \notin \zeta_t$, we must conclude that $\cfgnt{L}_\ell \lp \cfgnt{r}_0\rp \neq  \cfgnt{L}_\ell \lp \cfgnt{r}_1 \rp$. Because of this, and because of theorem \ref{thm:mutex}, we know that either all constraints $$\phi_i : \exists \phi_\alpha (\phi_\alpha \in \theta_\alpha)\wedge \phi_i = \lp\phi_\alpha \wedge \phi_0 \wedge \phi_1\rp$$ are unsatisfiable, or that at least one constraint $$\phi_i : \exists \phi_\alpha (\phi_\alpha \in \lp \theta_0 \cup \theta_1 \rp)\wedge \lp \phi_i = \phi_\alpha \wedge \phi_0 \wedge \phi_1 \rp$$ is valid. Either way, $\mathbb{S}\lp\phi_i^\prime \wedge\phi_0\wedge \phi_1\rp$ is false, $\lp g\ h\rp$ is not a valid homomorphism, and $s_s^\prime$ does not represent $s_i^\prime$. We have a contradiction. Therefore: $$s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime \Rightarrow s_\ell^\prime \in \zeta_t$$
Combining this with our previous result, we conclude that $$s_\ell^\prime \in \zeta_t \Leftrightarrow s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$$

Case 2: Assume $s_\ell : \cfgnt{L}_\ell \lp \cfgnt{r}_0\rp \neq \cfgnt{L}_\ell \lp \cfgnt{r}_1 \rp$, and let 
$$\zeta_f = \zeta_T \setminus \{ s_t | \cfgnt{L}_t \lp \cfgnt{r}_0\rp = \cfgnt{L}_t \lp \cfgnt{r}_1 \rp \}$$ 
This means that the lazy ``equals - references false" rule applies. The proof for the ``equals - references false" rule is highly similar to the proof for ``equals - references true", so we omit it for the sake of brevity. The result for this case is:
$$s_\ell^\prime \in \zeta_f \Leftrightarrow s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$$

Since $\zeta_T = \zeta_t \cup \zeta_f$, we can combine the results of the two cases to find that $$s_\ell^\prime \in \zeta_T \Leftrightarrow s_\ell^\prime \sqsubset s_s^\prime$$. By definition \ref{equivalent}, $s_s^\prime \equiv \zeta_T$, and by definition \ref{exact}, $s_s^\prime$ is exact.
\end{proof}
