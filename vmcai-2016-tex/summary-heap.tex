\subsection{Symbolic Heap}

%Determining the symbolic state is relatively simple for programs that perform linear manipulations of numeric input parameters. However, the task becomes more challenging for programs that accept references as inputs, in part because it is not obvious exactly how many program input parameters there are. For example, consider the case of dereferencing an input reference that points to an object that itself contains multiple fields. Should each of those field values be included as program input parameters? What if some of the fields contain references? It would seem as if dereferencing symbolic input references opens the door to a potentially unbounded number of parameters. 

%Our solution treats the heap as a hidden input parameter to every program.
%expressed completely in terms of a black-box symbolic input heap
%and the input reference parameters.
The collective state of all symbolic program reference values
is known as the \emph{symbolic heap}. Our symbolic heap 
is a field sensitive points-to graph with edges
annotated with disjunctive formulas describing aliasing
relationships. We represent the symbolic heap as a bipartite graph on
references, $\cfgnt{r}$, and constraint location pairs,
$\lp\phi\ \cfgnt{l}\rp$. The graph is expressed in the location map,
$\cfgnt{L}$, and the reference map, $\cfgnt{R}$. As done with the
environment, $\cfgnt{L}$ and $\cfgnt{R}$ are treated as partial
functions. $\cfgnt{L}(r) = \{(\phi\ \cfgnt{l})\ ...\}$ is the set
of constraint-location pairs (value set) in the heap associated with the given
reference. The constraint associated with each location is a guard
representing the conditions under which the associated reference
maps to the given location. By definition, any location appears 
at most once in any given value set. Unions of value sets containing
the same location are resolved by forming a disjunction of the constraints
from each set. $\cfgnt{R}(\cfgnt{l}, \cfgnt{f}) = \cfgnt{r}$ is the
reference associated with the given location-field pair in the
heap. References in the graph are immutable. Locations, however, are
mutated on updates.

\caption{Example Symbolic Heap}
\label{fig:exampleHeap}
\end{figure}

\figref{fig:exampleHeap} shows an example symbolic heap. References are 
represented by circles and locations are represented by squares. Arrows leaving
references correspond to the value sets returned by the $\cfgnt{L}$ function, and 
arrows leaving the squares correspond to the $\cfgnt{R}$ function.

The soundness and completeness proofs in Section~\ref{sec:bisim} rely
on certain characteristics of the symbolic heap that are preserved by
the small-step semantics during symbolic execution:

\begin{compactdesc}
\item[Reference partitions:] Each reference belongs to one of three partitions: $\mathrm{init}_\cfgnt{r}()$ for the \emph{input
  heap}% that includes $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null}$ (these are created by lazy initialization and are the only references that appear as variables in constraints)
  ; $\mathrm{fresh}_\cfgnt{r}()$ for \emph{auxiliary
  literals}% that includes $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{un}$ (these add structure but do not appear elsewhere)
  ; and $\mathrm{stack}_\cfgnt{r}()$ for \emph{stack
  literals}. %(these appear in environments, expressions, and continuations).
  Only input heap references appear in constraints to express potential aliasing.
  Auxiliary literals and stack references are used to define additional structure in the bipartite graph but only stack references can appear in environments, expressions, or continuations.
\item[Null and Uninitialized:] Every symbolic heap contains 
two special locations, null ($\cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null}$), and uninitialized,
  ($\cfgnt{l}_\mathit{un}$)  with corresponding references 
  $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null}$ and $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{un}$ 
  where $\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null}) =
  \{(\cfgt{true}\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null})\}$ and
  $\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{un}) =
  \{(\cfgt{true}\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{un})\}$. 
\item[Immutability:] References do not change once added to the
location map, eliminating any need for constraint rewriting as the program state evolves.
\item[Determinism:] A reference in $(\cfgnt{L}\ \cfgnt{R})$ cannot point to multiple locations simultaneously: 
$
\forall \cfgnt{r} \in \cfgnt{L}^\leftarrow\ (\forall (\phi\ \cfgnt{l}),(\phi^\prime\ \cfgnt{l}^\prime) \in \cfgnt{L}(r)\ (
(\cfgnt{l} \neq \cfgnt{l}^\prime \vee \phi \neq \phi^\prime) \Rightarrow (\phi \wedge \phi^\prime = \cfgt{false}))
$
where $\cfgnt{L}^\leftarrow$ is the pre-image of $\cfgnt{L}$. 
\item[Type consistency:] All locations associated with a reference have the same type:
$\forall \cfgnt{r} \in \cfgnt{L}^\leftarrow\ (\forall (\phi\ \cfgnt{l}),(\phi^\prime\ \cfgnt{l}^\prime) \in \cfgnt{L}(r)\ (
(\mathrm{Type}\lp\cfgnt{l}\rp = \mathrm{Type}\lp\cfgnt{l}^\prime\rp)))$

\end{compactdesc}


\subsection{Symbolic Execution Semantics}

Symbolic execution semantics are is defined using
a small-step operational semantics similar to the one presented 
in~\cite{saints-MS}. The small-step semantics,
defined as a syntactic machine using a CESK architecture~\cite{Felleisen:1992},
are modified to perform symbolic execution on a symbolic heap. The
surface (input) syntax and machine (state) syntax are shown
in~\figref{fig:syntax}. Terminals are in bold face while non-terminals
are italicized. Ellipses indicate zero or more repetitions. Tuples
omit the commas for compactness.

\end{figure}

A program, $\cfgnt{P}$, is a registry of classes, $\mu$, with
a tuple indicating a class, $\cfgnt{C}$, and a method, $\cfgnt{m}$,
where execution starts. For simplicity in presentation, booleans are the only primitive type, 
classes have only non-primitive fields, and methods have a single
parameter. Expressions, $\cfgnt{e}$, include statements, and they use
'$\cfgt{:=}$' to indicate assignment and '$\cfgt{=}$' to indicate
comparison.  The dot-operator for field access is replaced by
'$\cfgt{\$}$', and the dot-operator for method invocation is replaced
by '$\cfgt{@}$' since '.' is reserved in PLT Redex. There is no
explicit return statement; rather, the value of the last expression is
used as the return value. A variable is always indicated by \cfgnt{x}
and a value by \cfgnt{v}. A value can be a reference in the heap,
$\cfgnt{r}$, or any of the special values shown
in~\figref{fig:syntax}(a).  Only type correct programs are given as
input to the machine.

The machine state $\cfgnt{s}$ includes the program
registry $\mu$, a pair of functions $\lp\cfgnt{L}\ \cfgnt{R}\rp$ which defines the heap, 
the path condition $\phi$ which is a constraint defined over
references in the heap, the environment  $\eta$ which maps local variables to references,
and the continuation $\cfgnt{k}$. The registry never changes so it is
omitted from the state tuple in the rest of the presentation.  The
more complex structures, such as the environment and heap, are defined
as singly linked lists of mappings that start with empty, \cfgnt{mt}. These lists are treated as
partial functions so $\eta(\cfgnt{x}) = \cfgnt{r}$ is the reference
$\cfgnt{r}$ associated with variable $\cfgnt{x}$. The notation
$\eta^\prime = \eta[\cfgnt{x} \mapsto \cfgnt{v}]$ defines a new
partial function $\eta^\prime$ that is the same as $\eta$ except that
the variable $\cfgnt{x}$ now maps to $\cfgnt{v}$. The continuation
$\cfgnt{k}$ indicates with $\cfgnt{*}$ where the expression $\cfgnt{e}$ came from, stores
temporary computation, and keeps track of the next continuation. For
example, the continuation $\lp\cfgt{*}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f}
\rightarrow \cfgnt{k}\rp$ indicates that the machine is evaluating the
expression for the object reference on which the field $\cfgnt{f}$ is
going to be accessed. Once the field access is complete, the machine
continues with $\cfgnt{k}$.


Given an input program $\lp\mu\ \lp\cfgnt{C}\ \cfgnt{m}\rp\rp$, the initial machine state is
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\lp\mu 
\ \cfgnt{L}[\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null} \mapsto \{\lp\cfgt{true}\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null})\}\rp] 
           [\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{un} \mapsto \{\lp\cfgt{true}\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{un}\rp\}] \\
\ \cfgnt{R}
\ \cfgt{true}\ \eta\  \lp\lp\cfgt{new}\ \cfgnt{C}\rp\ \cfgt{@}\ \cfgnt{m}\ \cfgt{true}\rp\rp\ \cfgt{end}\rp
\end{array}
$$
The expression in the initial state constructs a new object of type
$\cfgnt{C}$ and then invokes the method $\cfgnt{m}$ in that
object. 

The semantics are expressed as
rewrites on strings using pattern matching. Consider the rewrite rule
for the beginning of a field access instruction:
$$
\mprset{flushleft}
	\inferrule[Field Access(eval)]{}{
      \lp \cfgnt{L}\ \cfgnt{R}\ \phi\ \eta\ \lp \cfgnt{e}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f}\rp \ \cfgnt{k}\rp  \rcom 
      \lp \cfgnt{L}\ \cfgnt{R}\ \phi\ \eta\ \cfgnt{e}\ \lp \cfgt{*}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f} \rightarrow \cfgnt{k}\rp \rp 
	}
$$
If the string representing the current state matches the left side, then it
creates the new string on the right. In this example, the new string
on the right is now evaluating the expression $\cfgnt{e}$ in the field
access, and it includes the continuation indicating that it still
needs to complete the actual field access once the expression is
evaluated.

Other more complex rules, such as one to create a new instance of a
class, define constraints on the rewrites and more complex
transformations on the heap.
$$
\mprset{flushleft}
	\inferrule[New]{
      \cfgnt{r} = \mathrm{stack}_r\lp \rp\\
      l = \mathrm{fresh}_l\lp \cfgnt{C}\rp\\\\
      \cfgnt{R}^\prime = \cfgnt{R}[\forall \cfgnt{f} \in \mathit{fields}\lp \mathrm{C}\rp \ \lp \lp l\ \cfgnt{f}\rp  \mapsto \cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null} \rp ] \\\\
      \cfgnt{L}^\prime = \cfgnt{L}[\cfgnt{r} \mapsto \{\lp \cfgt{true}\ l\rp \}]
    }{
      \lp \cfgnt{L}\ \cfgnt{R}\ \phi\ \eta\ \lp \cfgt{new}\ \cfgnt{C}\rp \ \cfgnt{k}\rp  \rcom
      \lp \cfgnt{L}^\prime\ \cfgnt{R}^\prime\ \phi\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}\ \cfgnt{k}\rp 
	}
$$ In this rule, when the string matches the new-expression, it is
        rewritten to use a new heap location where all of the fields
        for the new object point to $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null}$ and the
        location map points a new stack reference to that new object.
        New heap locations returned from $\mathrm{fresh}_l$ are monotonically
        increasing.
        Also note that references for objects from the new-expression are
        auxiliary literals, so they do not appear in any constraint in
        the symbolic heap as an aliasing option.

The rewrite relations for the portion of the language
semantics that are common to both generalized symbolic execution and
the symbolic heap algorithm may be found in \cite{Hillery:2015}. The relation $\rcom$ includes all of these
rules. Excepting \textrm{N{\footnotesize EW}}, the rules do not update
the heap, and are largely concerned with argument evaluation in an
expected way. It is assumed that only type safe programs are input to
the machine so there is no type checking or error conditions. The
machine simply halts if no rewrite is enabled.
