\subsection{Symbolic Heap}

Our symbolic heap is a field sensitive points-to graph with edges
annotated with disjunctive formulas describing aliasing
relationships. We represent the symbolic heap as a bipartite graph on
references, $\cfgnt{r}$, and constraint location pairs,
$\lp\phi\ \cfgnt{l}\rp$. The graph is expressed in the location map,
$\cfgnt{L}$, and the reference map, $\cfgnt{R}$. As done with the
environment, $\cfgnt{L}$ and $\cfgnt{R}$ are treated as partial
functions where $\cfgnt{L}(r) = \{(\phi\ \cfgnt{l})\ ...\}$ is the set
of constraint-location pairs in the heap associated with the given
reference, and $\cfgnt{R}(\cfgnt{l},\cfgnt{f}) = \cfgnt{r}$ is the
reference associated with the given location-field pair in the
heap. References in the graph are immutable. Locations, however, are
mutated on updates.

\end{figure}

\figref{fig:exampleHeap} shows an example symbolic heap. References are 
represented by circles and locations are represented by squares. Arrows leaving
references correspond to the value sets returned by the $\cfgnt{L}$ function, and 
arrows leaving the squares correspond to the $\cfgnt{R}$ function.

The soundness and completeness proofs in Section~\ref{sec:bisim} rely
on certain characteristics of the symbolic heap that are preserved by
the small-step semantics during symbolic execution:

\begin{compactdesc}
\item[Reference partitions:] Each reference belongs to one of three partitions: $\mathrm{init}_\cfgnt{r}()$ for the \emph{input
  heap}% that includes $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null}$ (these are created by lazy initialization and are the only references that appear as variables in constraints)
  ; $\mathrm{fresh}_\cfgnt{r}()$ for \emph{auxiliary
  literals}% that includes $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{un}$ (these add structure but do not appear elsewhere)
  ; and $\mathrm{stack}_\cfgnt{r}()$ for \emph{stack
  literals} %(these appear in environments, expressions, and continuations).
\item[Null and Uninitialized:] Every symbolic heap contains 
two special locations, null ($\cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null}$), and uninitialized,
  ($\cfgnt{l}_\mathit{un}$) with $\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null}) =
  \{(\cfgt{true}\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null})\}$ and
  $\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{un}) =
  \{(\cfgt{true}\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{un})\}$. 
\item[Immutability:] References do not change once added to the
location map, eliminating any need for constraint rewriting as the program state evolves.
\item[Determinism:] A reference in $(\cfgnt{L}\ \cfgnt{R})$ cannot point to multiple locations simultaneously: 
$
\forall \cfgnt{r} \in \cfgnt{L}^\leftarrow\ (\forall (\phi\ \cfgnt{l}),(\phi^\prime\ \cfgnt{l}^\prime) \in \cfgnt{L}(r)\ (
(\cfgnt{l} \neq \cfgnt{l}^\prime \vee \phi \neq \phi^\prime) \Rightarrow (\phi \wedge \phi^\prime = \cfgt{false}))
$
where $\cfgnt{L}^\leftarrow$ is the pre-image of $\cfgnt{L}$. 
\item[Type consistency:] All locations associated with a reference have the same type:
$\forall \cfgnt{r} \in \cfgnt{L}^\leftarrow\ (\forall (\phi\ \cfgnt{l}),(\phi^\prime\ \cfgnt{l}^\prime) \in \cfgnt{L}(r)\ (
(\mathrm{Type}\lp\cfgnt{l}\rp = \mathrm{Type}\lp\cfgnt{l}^\prime\rp)))$

\end{compactdesc}

%\sjp{Up to now, no discussion of lazy initialization - what it is or
%  how it is being used.}  \nsr{A key insight to the summary heap is
%  that although many auxiliary or stack literals are created during
%  symbolic execution with lazy initialization, only input heap
%  references appear in the constraints expressing potential aliasing
%  relationships.}
A solver is used to reason over the aliasing relationships, and a
satisfying assignment uniquely identifies the set of aliasing
relationships that are representative of a concrete heap and its
shape. For example, if the solver assigns input heap variables
$\cfgnt{r}$ and $\cfgnt{r}^\prime$ such that $\cfgnt{r} =
\cfgnt{r}^\prime$ is true, then there exists some location $\cfgnt{l}$
and constraints $\phi$ and $\phi^\prime$ such that (i)
$\lp\phi\ \cfgnt{l}\rp \in \cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r})$; (ii)
$\lp\phi^\prime\ \cfgnt{l}\rp \in \cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}^\prime)$; and
(iii) $\phi$ and $\phi^\prime$ hold in the aliasing assignments from
the solver.  In this way, the graph groups heaps with the conditions
under which those heaps exist so look-ups are non-recursive and
updates do not modify the path condition or require rewrites on
constraints.


\subsection{Symbolic Execution Semantics}

In this work, symbolic execution semantics are is defined using
a small-step operational semantics similar to the one presented 
in~\cite{saints-MS}. The small-step semantics,
defined as a syntactic machine using a CESK architecture~\cite{Felleisen:1992},
are modified to perform symbolic execution on a symbolic heap. The
surface (input) syntax and machine (state) syntax are shown
in~\figref{fig:syntax}. Terminals are in bold face while non-terminals
are italicized. Ellipses indicate zero or more repetitions. Tuples
omit the commas for compactness.

\caption{Syntax for Javalite. (a) The Javalite surface syntax. (b) The machine syntax with $\bowtie\ \in \{\wedge,\vee,\Rightarrow\}$.}
\label{fig:syntax}
\end{figure}

A program, $\cfgnt{P}$, is a registry of classes, $\mu$, with
a tuple indicating a class, $\cfgnt{C}$, and a method, $\cfgnt{m}$,
where execution starts. The only primitive type in Javalite is
Boolean. For simplicity in presentation, classes have only
non-primitive fields, and methods have a single
parameter. Expressions, $\cfgnt{e}$, include statements, and they use
'$\cfgt{:=}$' to indicate assignment and '$\cfgt{=}$' to indicate
comparison.  The dot-operator for field access is replaced by
'$\cfgt{\$}$', and the dot-operator for method invocation is replaced
by '$\cfgt{@}$' since '.' is reserved in PLT Redex. There is no
explicit return statement; rather, the value of the last expression is
used as the return value. A variable is always indicated by \cfgnt{x}
and a value by \cfgnt{v}. A value can be a reference in the heap,
$\cfgnt{r}$, or any of the special values shown
in~\figref{fig:syntax}(a).  Only type correct programs are given as
input to the machine.

The state of the machine, $\cfgnt{s}$, includes the program
registry, $\mu$, a pair of functions defining the heap
$\lp\cfgnt{L}\ \cfgnt{R}\rp$, a constraint, $\phi$, defined over
references in the heap, the environment, $\eta$, for local variables,
and the continuation $\cfgnt{k}$. The registry never changes so it is
omitted from the state tuple in the rest of the presentation.  The
more complex structures, such as the environment and heap, are defined
as lists that start with empty, \cfgnt{mt}. These lists are treated as
partial functions so $\eta(\cfgnt{x}) = \cfgnt{r}$ is the reference
$\cfgnt{r}$ associated with variable $\cfgnt{x}$. The notation
$\eta^\prime = \eta[\cfgnt{x} \mapsto \cfgnt{v}]$ defines a new
partial function $\eta^\prime$ that is the same as $\eta$ except that
the variable $\cfgnt{x}$ now maps to $\cfgnt{v}$. The continuation
$\cfgnt{k}$ indicates where the hole, $\cfgt{*}$, is located, stores
temporary computation, and keeps track of the next computation. For
example, the continuation $\lp\cfgt{*}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f}
\rightarrow \cfgnt{k}\rp$ indicates that the machine is evaluating the
expression for the object reference on which the field $\cfgnt{f}$ is
going to be accessed. Once the field access is complete, the machine
continues with $\cfgnt{k}$.


Given an input program $\lp\mu\ \lp\cfgnt{C}\ \cfgnt{m}\rp\rp$, the initial machine state is
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\lp\mu 
\ \cfgnt{L}[\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null} \mapsto \{\lp\cfgt{true}\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null})\}\rp] 
           [\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{un} \mapsto \{\lp\cfgt{true}\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{un}\rp\}] \\
\ \cfgnt{R}
\ \cfgt{true}\ \eta\  \lp\lp\cfgt{new}\ \cfgnt{C}\rp\ \cfgt{@}\ \cfgnt{m}\ \cfgt{true}\rp\rp\ \cfgt{end}\rp
\end{array}
$$
The expression in the initial state constructs a new object of type
$\cfgnt{C}$ and then invokes the method $\cfgnt{m}$ in that
object. 

The semantics are expressed as
rewrites on strings using pattern matching. Consider the rewrite rule
for the beginning of a field access instruction:
$$
\mprset{flushleft}
	\inferrule[Field Access(eval)]{}{
      \lp \cfgnt{L}\ \cfgnt{R}\ \phi\ \eta\ \lp \cfgnt{e}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f}\rp \ \cfgnt{k}\rp  \rcom 
      \lp \cfgnt{L}\ \cfgnt{R}\ \phi\ \eta\ \cfgnt{e}\ \lp \cfgt{*}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{f} \rightarrow \cfgnt{k}\rp \rp 
	}
$$
If the string representing the current state matches the left side, then it
creates the new string on the right. In this example, the new string
on the right is now evaluating the expression $\cfgnt{e}$ in the field
access, and it includes the continuation indicating that it still
needs to complete the actual field access once the expression is
evaluated.

Other more complex rules, such as one to create a new instance of a
class, define constraints on the rewrites and more complex
transformations on the heap.
$$
\mprset{flushleft}
	\inferrule[New]{
      \cfgnt{r} = \mathrm{stack}_r\lp \rp\\
      l = \mathrm{fresh}_l\lp \cfgnt{C}\rp\\\\
      \cfgnt{R}^\prime = \cfgnt{R}[\forall \cfgnt{f} \in \mathit{fields}\lp \mathrm{C}\rp \ \lp \lp l\ \cfgnt{f}\rp  \mapsto \cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null} \rp ] \\\\
      \cfgnt{L}^\prime = \cfgnt{L}[\cfgnt{r} \mapsto \{\lp \cfgt{true}\ l\rp \}]
    }{
      \lp \cfgnt{L}\ \cfgnt{R}\ \phi\ \eta\ \lp \cfgt{new}\ \cfgnt{C}\rp \ \cfgnt{k}\rp  \rcom
      \lp \cfgnt{L}^\prime\ \cfgnt{R}^\prime\ \phi\ \eta\ \cfgnt{r}\ \cfgnt{k}\rp 
	}
$$ In this rule, when the string matches the new-expression, it is
        rewritten to use a new heap location where all of the fields
        for the new object point to $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null}$ and the
        location map points a new stack reference to that new object.
        Note that references for objects from the new-expression are
        auxiliary literals, so they do not appear in any constraint in
        the symbolic heap as an aliasing option.

The rewrite relations for the portion of the language
semantics that are common to both generalized symbolic execution and
the symbolic heap algorithm may be found in \cite{Hillery:2015}. The relation $\rcom$ includes all of these
rules. Excepting \textrm{N{\footnotesize EW}}, the rules do not update
the heap, and are largely concerned with argument evaluation in an
expected way. It is assumed that only type safe programs are input to
the machine so there is no type checking or error conditions. The
machine simply halts if no rewrite is enabled.
