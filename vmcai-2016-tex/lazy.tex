\section{GSE}
\label{app:gse}
GSE semantics are defined here to give insight to the new symbolic initialization approach and support the proof that the new approach preserves GSE behaviors. GSE and its variants have the same non-deterministic choice given a reference to an uninitialized object; that reference can point to null, a new instance of an object with the correct type, or to an object of the same type that has been instantiated previously by GSE \cite{GSE03,KiasanKunit,Cadar:2008,Rosner:2015}. The objects instantiated for new instances are referred to as the \emph{input heap}. Only these objects comprise the potential alias set when GSE encounters references to uninitialized objects. In general, the GSE search space branches at uninitialized objects, and the number of branches depends on the size of the input heap.

The lazy initialization rules for GSE on the symbolic heap are in
\figref{fig:lazyInit}: NULL, new, and alias. The rules rely on fresh references and locations that strictly increase so it is possible to minimize over a set to find the first created. Further, references are partitioned to support latter proofs: $\mathrm{init}_\cfgnt{r}()$ for the input
  heap
  ; $\mathrm{fresh}_\cfgnt{r}()$ for \emph{auxiliary
  literals}
  ; and $\mathrm{stack}_\cfgnt{r}()$ for \emph{stack
    literals}.
  In general, as shown in the next section,
  only input heap references appear in constraints to express potential aliasing, and only stack references appear in environments, expressions, or continuations.  Finally, the \emph{isInit} function is true for initialized references from the input heap (i.e., potential aliases). 

How the lazy
initialization is used is defined in \figref{fig:lazy}. Specifically,
the field-access rule in \figref{fig:lazy} uses initialization,
$\rightarrow_I^*$, to ensure the accessed field is
instantiated. Initialization in generalized symbolic execution never
happens for more than one object on any use of $\rightarrow_I^*$:
$\Lambda$ is either empty or contains exactly one location. This property is an artifact of how GSE case spits when it instantiates: each choice is a new unique heap. The rest of the rules in \figref{fig:lazy} do not initialize, but they are included to elucidate how symbolic initialization differs from GSE with lazy initialization. In particular, there is no branching in the search space on reference compare for GSE because references point to a single location. The new symbolic initialization using guarded value sets in the next section changes this behavior. 


The $\rgse$ relation defined in \figref{fig:lazy} is a union over branching points on control flow
to support the final proof of the existence of a
bisimulation. Although it is apparent that there is non-determinism in
initialization at the first access to an uninitialized reference, control flow branches at comparisons and NULL-exceptions. This property is reflected in the composition of $\rgse$.
