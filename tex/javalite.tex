\section{Javalite}
\figref{fig:surface-syntax} defines the surface syntax for the
Javalite language \cite{saints-MS}. \figref{fig:machine-syntax} is the
machine syntax. Javalite is syntactic machine defined as rewrites on a
string. The semantics use a CEKS model with a (C)ontrol string
representing the expression being evaluated, an (E)nvironment for
local variables, a (K)ontinuation for what is to be executed next, and
a (S)tore for the heap.

The environment, $\eta$, associates a variable $\cfgnt{x}$ with a
value $\cfgnt{v}$. The value can be a reference, $\cfgnt{r}$ or one of
the special values $\cfgt{null}$, $\cfgt{true}$, or
$\cfgt{false}$. Although the Javalite machine is purely syntactic, for
clarity and brevity in the presentation, the more complex structures
such as the environment are treated as partial functions. As such,
$\eta(\cfgnt{x}) = \cfgnt{r}$ is the reference mapped to the variable
in the environment. The notation $\eta^\prime = \eta[\cfgnt{x} \mapsto
  \cfgnt{v}]$ defines a new partial function $\eta^\prime$ that is
just like $\eta$ only the variable $\cfgnt{x}$ now maps to
$\cfgnt{v}$.

The heap is a labeled bipartite graph consisting of references,
$\cfgnt{r}$, and locations, $\cfgnt{l}$. The machine syntax in
\figref{fig:machine-syntax} defines that graph in $\cfgnt{L}$, the
location map, and $\cfgnt{R}$, the reference map. As done with the
environment, $\cfgnt{L}$ and $\cfgnt{R}$ are treated as partial
functions where $\cfgnt{L}(r) = \{(\phi\ \cfgnt{l})\ ...\}$ is the set
of location-constraint pairs in the heap associated with the given
reference, and $\cfgnt{R}(\cfgnt{l},\cfgnt{f}) = \cfgnt{r}$ is the
reference associated with the given location-field pair in the
heap. 

As the updates to $\cfgnt{L}$ and $\cfgnt{R}$ are complex in the
machine semantics, predicate calculus is used to describe updates to
the functions. Consider the following example where $\cfgnt{l}$ is
some location and$\rho$ is a set of references.
\[
\cfgnt{L}^\prime = \cfgnt{L}[\cfgnt{r} \mapsto \{\lp \cfgt{true}\ l\rp \}][\forall \cfgnt{r}^\prime \in \rho\ \lp \cfgnt{r}^\prime \mapsto \lp \cfgt{true}\ l_\mathit{null}\rp \rp ]
\]
The new partial function $\cfgnt{L}^\prime$ is just like $\cfgnt{L}$ only it
remaps $\cfgnt{r}$, and it remaps all the references in $\rho$. 

The location $\cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null}$ is a special location in the heap
to represent null. It has a companion reference
$\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null}$. The initial heap for the machine is defined
such that $\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{null}) = \{(\cfgt{true}\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null})\}$

The initial state of the machine needs to be defined.
