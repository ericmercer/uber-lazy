\section{Generating and Updating Symbolic Heaps}
\label{sec:precise}

Unlike~\gsetxt{}, the symbolic heap algorithm only partitions the heap at comparison
operations or for exception handling.  There are three sets of rewrite
rules specific to the symbolic heap algorithm: (i) rules to initialize
symbolic references, (ii) rules to perform field dereferences and
writes, and (iii) rules to check equality and inequality of
references.

\label{fig:symInit}
\end{figure*}

The initialization rule in \figref{fig:symInit} is invoked whenever a
field within an uninitialized reference is accessed. The interaction
with the solver in the definition of the rules is denoted by
$\mathbb{S}(\phi)$ which returns true if $\phi$ is satisfiable.  The
check for uninitialized references is determined by the function
$\mathbb{UN}(\cfgnt{L}, \cfgnt{R}, \cfgnt{r}, \cfgnt{f}) =
\{\lp\phi\ \cfgnt{l}\rp\ ...\}$ which returns constraint-location
pairs where the field $\cfgnt{f}$ is uninitialized.
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mathbb{UN}(\cfgnt{L}, \cfgnt{R}, \cfgnt{r}, \cfgnt{f}) & = &\{ \lp\phi\ \cfgnt{l}\rp \mid \lp \phi\ \cfgnt{l}\rp  \in \cfgnt{L}\lp \cfgnt{r}\rp  \wedge \\ & &
 \ \ \exists \phi^\prime \lp \lp \phi^\prime\ \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{un}\rp  \in \cfgnt{L}\lp \cfgnt{R}\lp l,\cfgnt{f}\rp\rp \wedge \\ & &
 \ \ \mathbb{S}\lp \phi \wedge \phi^\prime \rp\rp\}\\
\end{array}
\]

In~\figref{fig:symInit}, given the uninitialized set $\Lambda$ for
field $f$, the $\mathrm{min}_l$ function returns
$(\phi_x\ \cfgnt{l}_x)$ based on a lexicographical ordering of
uninitialized locations in $\Lambda$ to make initialization
deterministic.  The set $\rho$ contains reference-location pairs that
represent potential aliases, where $\mathrm{isInit}\lp\rp$ ensures that the references are initialized. 
There are four cases encoded in the
symbolic heap: (i) $\theta_\mathit{null}$ represents the condition
where $\cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null}$ is possible, (ii)
$\theta_\mathit{new}$ represents the case where $\cfgnt{r}_f$ points
to a fresh location, (iii) each member of $\theta_\mathit{alias}$
restricts $\cfgnt{r}_f$ to a particular alias in $\rho$, and at the
same time, not alias any member of $\rho$ that was initialized earlier
than the current choice, and (iv) $\theta_\mathit{orig}$ implements
conditional initialization to preserve the original heap structure.
These sets are added into the heap on $\cfgnt{r}_f$ after the fields
for $\cfgnt{l}_f$ are initialized to $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{un}$.

We visualize the initialization process in~\figref{fig:initHeap}. The
graph in~\figref{fig:initHeap}(a) represents the initial heap. The
reference superscripts $s$ and $i$ indicate the partition containing
the reference.  In~\figref{fig:initHeap}, $\cfgnt{r}_0^s$ represents a
stack reference for the $\cfgt{this}$ variable which has two fields
$x$ and $y$ of the same type. Note that when no constraint is
specified for a location, there is an implicit $\mathit{true}$
constraint. For example, $\cfgnt{r}_0^s$ points to $\cfgnt{l}_0$ on
the constraint $\mathit{true}$. The fields $x$ and $y$ point to the
uninitialized reference $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{un}$. The graph
in~\figref{fig:initHeap}(b) represents the symbolic heap after the
initialization of the $\lp\cfgt{this}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{x}\rp$ field
while the graph in~\figref{fig:initHeap}(c) represents the symbolic
heap after the initialization of the
$\lp\cfgt{this}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{y}\rp$ field following the
initialization of $\lp\cfgt{this}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{x}\rp$. The list
in~\figref{fig:initHeap}(d) represents the various sets constructed in
initialization rule for $\lp\cfgt{this}\ \cfgt{\$}\ \cfgnt{y}\rp$. We
also define values of constraints used as labels in the graph.

\caption{Field read and write relations: Field-access, $\rsym^\mathit{A}$, and field-write, $\rsym^\mathit{W}$, rewrite rules for the $\rsym$ relation.}
\label{fig:fHeap}
\end{figure*}

There are two rewrite rules in~\figref{fig:fHeap}(a), one for reading
the value of a field (field-access) and the other when we write to a
field (field-write). Both rules first check that the operations can be
performed on a non-null location. The field-access rewrite rule
in~\figref{fig:fHeap} dereferences a field of type $\cfgnt{C}$ and
uses \figref{fig:symInit}, to get a new symbolic heap that is
initialized on the field $\cfgnt{f}$. The symbolic heap is further
modified to include a new stack reference pointing to the value set
(possible values of the field) returned during the dereferencing; the
new stack reference is the return value from the operation.


 \input{value-set-def} 

For a reference $\cfgnt{r}$ and field $\cfgnt{f}$, the value set function computes 
the set of locations that the field could dereference to, paired with a local and valid access path constraint
that is feasible under the current path condition $\phi_g$.
The access path constraint is the union of two local constraints: 
the constraint $\phi$ from dereferencing $\cfgnt{r}$ to location $\cfgnt{l}$, 
and the constraint $\phi^\prime$ from dereferencing the field $\cfgnt{f}$ of the location $\cfgnt{l}$ to the actual location of the field, $\cfgnt{l}^\prime$. 
This access path constraint, paired with location $\cfgnt{l}^\prime$, is a member of the value set only if its union with the path condition is satisfiable, ensuring that the access path is valid and feasible under the path condition.

For field-write in~\figref{fig:fHeap}, after the non-null check and
strengthening of the global heap constraint, it computes the current
references associated with the field in every location in
$\Psi_\cfgnt{x}$. Note that the reference $\cfgnt{r}_x$ is the base
reference whose field, $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$ is being written to,
while the reference $r$ is the target reference. The set $\Psi_x$
contains tuples $(\phi\ l\ \cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur})$ of constraints,
locations, and references. These tuples represent access chains
leading from $\cfgnt{r}_x$ to the reference of the field,
$\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$. The goal is to change the fields to no
longer point to $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$, but rather fresh references
that have both the original locations before the write and the
locations from the write in the value sets (i.e., conditional
write). Since the target of the write is $r$, the rule checks that the
location constraint pairs of $\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r})$ are satisfiable
when accessed through the $\cfgnt{r}_x$ chain in the strengthening
function.  \input{st-def} Constraints on locations are strengthened
with new aliasing conditions and those that are feasible with the
current path condition are retained.

Strengthening in the field write creates a value set that contains two
types of locations: those for the case where the write is feasible
(the first call), and those for the case where it is not (the second
call). In the case that $\phi$ is true then $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$
will point to the constraint location pairs of $\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r})$.
Whereas, if $\phi$ is false then $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$ will
continue to point to the constraint location pair it currently
references.  As the references are immutable, the rule creates fresh
references for each $\cfgnt{r}_\mathit{cur}$ and points them to the
appropriate value sets.

\caption{The reference compare rewrite rule for true, $\rsym^\mathit{E}$ outcomes.}
\label{fig:eqs}
\end{figure*}


The rewrite rule to compare two references in the symbolic heap is
shown in~\figref{fig:eqs}. The equals references-true rewrite rule
returns true when two references $\cfgnt{r}_0$ and $\cfgnt{r}_1$
\emph{can} be equal. Intutively, $\Phi_\alpha$ contains all
constraints under which $\cfgnt{r}_0$ and $\cfgnt{r}_1$ may point to
the same location in the symbolic heap. The second set, $\Phi_0$,
contains constraints under which the reference $\cfgnt{r}_0$ points to
corresponding locations such that the reference $\cfgnt{r}_1$
\emph{does not} point to those locations under any
constraint. Finally, the set, $\Phi_1$, contains constraints under
which $\cfgnt{r}_1$ points to corresponding locations and
$\cfgnt{r}_0$ \emph{does not} point to those locations under any
constraint. We use the three sets of constraints to create a new path condition $\phi_g^\prime$
as an update of the current path condition $\phi_g$. We add to $\phi_g$ the disjunction of the
constraints in $\Phi_\alpha$ to indicate that if any of the
constraints are satisfiable, then references $\cfgnt{r}_0$ and
$\cfgnt{r}_1$ can be equal. Furthermore, we conjoin to the global heap
constraint $\phi_g^\prime$, the conjunctions of negations to the
constraints in $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_1$. This indicates for locations
that are not common to the references, the negations of their
constraints are satisfiable. The rule does not complete (i.e., is not
feasible) if the new global constraint is not satisfied on any
aliasing assignment. In such a case, the $\cfgt{true}$ outcome is not
possible on any symbolic heap. Before the rewrite rule returns
$\cfgt{true}$ we check the satisfiability of the updated global heap
constraint. The reference-false is the logical dual of the rule.


Consider the example in~\figref{fig:initHeap}(c). In order to to check
if $\cfgnt{r}_1^i$ and $\cfgnt{r}_2^i$ are equal we first get the constraint location
pairs associated with each of the references:
\[
\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_1^i) = \{ (\phi_{1a}\; \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null})\; (\phi_{1b}\; \cfgnt{l}_1) \} 
\]
\[
\cfgnt{L}(\cfgnt{r}_2^i) = \{ (\phi_{2a}\; \cfgnt{l}_\mathit{null})\; (\phi_{2b}\; \cfgnt{l}_2)\; (\phi_{2c}\; \cfgnt{l}_1) \} \\
\]
\noindent{The three constraint sets are:} 
\[
\Phi_\alpha = \{ (\phi_{1a}\; \wedge\; \phi_{2a} ) (\phi_{1b}\; \wedge\; \phi_{2c} ) \}\;
\Phi_0 = \{ \}\; \Phi_1 = \{ \phi_{2b}\} \\
\]
\noindent{Finally the global constraint is} 
\[
\phi^\prime = \mathit{true} \wedge [ (\phi_{1a}\; \wedge\; \phi_{2a} )\vee (\phi_{1b}\; \wedge\; \phi_{2c} ) ] \wedge \neg\phi_{2b} 
\]
